### Hi there üëã

I'm James/Jim, a Full Stack software developer from the south of Wales. I enjoy all sorts of programming but professionally experienced with Full stack and a bit of dev-ops.

I spend a big chunk of my time learning, whether it's about rockets, science or languages. &nbsp;

I see software developers as generalists, we have real power to solve problems in our day to day lives. For example, a [silly movie app](https://github.com/Reesy/react-experiment-video-player) so I can group watch home movies with my partner in Japan, or creating a networked [OS based toast announcer](https://github.com/Reesy/cronjob-toast-requester) to remind myself to make tea!

# Template Projects:

I probably take DRY/YAGNI a bit too seriously, so I tend to make templates for every bit of new tech I work on. 
Feel free to use any of these templates however you see fit:

# Reference Projects: 

These projects are purely for reference they are more for my benefit but I hope you find them useful too!

I find it useful to build up something from the very basics in a project before working on them in another (I have a terrible memory!)
