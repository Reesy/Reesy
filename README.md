### Hi there üëã

I'm James/Jim, a Full Stack software developer from the south of Wales. I enjoy all sorts of programming but professionally experienced with Full stack and a bit of dev-ops.

I spend a big chunk of my time learning, whether it's about rockets, science or languages. &nbsp;

I see software developers as generalists, we have real power to solve problems in our day to day lives. <br>
Options are limitless, like making a [silly movie app](https://github.com/Reesy/react-experiment-video-player) so I can group watch home movies with my partner in Japan, or creating a networked [OS based toast announcer](https://github.com/Reesy/cronjob-toast-requester) to remind myself to make tea!

# Template Projects:

I probably take DRY/YAGNI a bit too seriously, so I tend to make templates for every bit of new tech I work on. 
Feel free to use any of these templates however you see fit:
